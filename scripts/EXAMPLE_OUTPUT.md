## Expected Workspace Content

### Overview
The script creates a comprehensive threat model for GitHub repositories and authentication, covering:
- **Source Code Security**: Protecting repository integrity and access
- **Authentication Systems**: GitHub login, tokens, and access controls
- **Supply Chain Security**: CI/CD pipelines and dependency management

### Assumptions (30 items)
Security and compliance assumptions including:
- "The organization has audit and accountability policy and procedures." (AU-1)
- "The organization has access control policy and procedures in place." (AC-1)
- "Physical media threats are not applicable to SaaS software accessible via public internet."

### Mitigations (12 items)
Concrete security controls such as:
- **Race condition protection** - Workflow security measures (AC-4, PL-8, SI-7.2)
- **Monitor and Audit Settings** - Repository configuration monitoring (AU-6, CM-3, SI-4)
- **Incident response plan** - Security incident procedures (IR-1, IR-2, IR-3)
- **MFA & Fine-grained tokens** - Authentication security (AC-3, IA-2, IA-5)

### Threats (33 items)
Real-world security threats including:
- **External threat actors** exploiting failover mechanisms during disaster recovery
- **Malicious users** bypassing code review controls to merge unreviewed changes
- **Internal threat actors** sharing private repository contents with unauthorized collaborators

### Data Flow Diagram
Visual representation showing:
- **GitHub Trust Boundary** containing authentication services and repositories
- **External Actors**: Anonymous users, privileged users, 3rd party applications
- **Authentication Methods**: SSH keys, personal access tokens, passwords/2FA
- **Repository Types**: Public and private repositories, GitHub Actions

## Browser Interface Expectations

### Workspaces Overview Page
Users would see:
- List of workspaces including the newly created "GitHub Authentication Threat Model"
- Workspace creation date and owner information
- Quick stats showing number of threats, mitigations, and assumptions

### Workspace Detail Page
Users would access:
- **Dashboard**: Threat statistics, priority distribution, STRIDE analysis
- **Architecture**: GitHub security architecture documentation
- **Data Flow**: Interactive diagram of authentication flows
- **Threats**: Detailed threat catalog with STRIDE categorization
- **Mitigations**: Security controls mapped to threats
- **Assumptions**: Foundational security assumptions

This provides a realistic, comprehensive threat modeling workspace for development and training purposes.
